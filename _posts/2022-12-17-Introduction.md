On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presented an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems, and work in the past two years. Tourism is one of the sectors hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**Airbnb** , a platform that enables people to find short to longer-term accommodation, has faced many challenges during the pandemic.

This project aims to use New York City as a case, study how the pandemic influenced the Airbnb market in different aspects, and provide advice for both Airbnb hosts and guests in the post-pandemic future. The data used in this project are mainly from [InsideAirbnb][InsideAirbnb], [NYC OpenData][NYC OpenData] and [OpenStreetMap][OpenStreetMap].   

This project will be divided into three parts:
-  Influence of the pandemic on NYC's Airbnb market
-  NYC's Airbnb market change at the neighborhood level
-  Price recommendation for Airbnb hosts post-pandemic
